# Webpack Configuration

The configuration of Webpack bundles is handled by adding standard Webpack configuration files within
your project. There are a few required settings which will ensure that your bundles are compiled
correctly and can be accessed from template helpers, etc.

Mimimal Example:

```js
const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {

    name: 'main',

    context: path.resolve(__dirname),

    entry: {
        blog: ['./js/app.js'],
    },

    output: {
        filename: '[name].bundle.js',
        path: '/'
    }
}
```

### name

You must provide a name so that your asset bundles can be retrieved using the webpack_asset() template helper

### context

You must provide a context to the current configuration file so that the entry point can be resolved correctly.
