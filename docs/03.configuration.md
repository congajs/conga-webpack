# Configuration

Example:

```yaml
webpack:

    # turn development mode on/off (dev middleware / hot reloading)
    development: true

    # when development is off, force build to happen on each server start
    force.build: false

    # the public path to serve files in dev mode under
    public.dev.path: "/_dev/"

    # the public directory to build files to
    build.path: "/build/"

    # the paths to each of the webpack config files
    config.paths: []
    #    - "demo-bundle:resources/public/webpack.config.dev.js"
    #    - "other-bundle:resources/public/webpack.config.dev.js"
```

## Settings

### development

Turning the "development" setting on (true) will use webpack-dev-middleware which will automatically
recompile your changes to memory.

### force.build

When development mode is off, turning this on (true) will force the asset files to be compiled on
each server start up. This is useful in development to diagnose any issues with compilation builds
prior to going to production.

### public.dev.path

When development mode is turned on, this will be the public path that the assets are served from.

### build.path

This is the directory within your app/public directory which assets will be compiled to.

### config.paths

This is an array in which you specify the namespaced paths to webpack config files within your project.
